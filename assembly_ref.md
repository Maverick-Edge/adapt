Cache Invalidation: Caches store frequently accessed data. When the original data changes, caches must be updated or invalidated to prevent using stale data.
Race Conditions: In multi-threaded programming, a race condition occurs when multiple threads access and modify shared data concurrently, potentially leading to unpredictable or erroneous behavior.
Memory Leaks: Memory that is allocated but never freed remains unavailable for use by other programs or even within the same program, leading to resource exhaustion over time.
Dangling Pointers: A dangling pointer is a pointer that refers to memory that has been deallocated (freed).

Off-by-One Errors: Incorrect loop bounds or array indexing, leading to accessing one element too many or too few.
Null Pointer Dereference: Attempting to access memory through a pointer that points to nothing (NULL/nullptr).
Dangling Pointers: Pointers that refer to memory that has already been deallocated.
Memory Leaks: Failure to free dynamically allocated memory after it's no longer needed.
Double Free Errors: Attempting to free the same memory block multiple times.
Use-After-Free Errors: Accessing memory that has been freed but is still referenced by a pointer.
Buffer Overflows/Overruns: Writing data beyond the allocated size of a buffer, overwriting adjacent memory.
Integer Overflow/Underflow: Exceeding the maximum or minimum representable value of an integer type, resulting in incorrect calculations.
Uninitialized Variables: Using variables before assigning them a value, leading to undefined behavior.
Race Conditions: In multi-threaded programming, multiple threads access and modify shared data concurrently without proper synchronization, resulting in unpredictable behavior.
Deadlocks: A situation where two or more threads are blocked indefinitely, waiting for each other to release resources.
Stack Overflows: Excessive recursion or the use of too many local variables, exceeding the stack's capacity.
Endianness Issues: Incorrectly interpreting the byte order of data, especially when transferring data between different systems.
Cache Invalidation Problems: Failing to properly update or invalidate cached data when the original data changes, resulting in the use of stale data.
Bit Manipulation Errors: Incorrectly using bitwise operators, leading to unintended consequences.
Segmentation Faults: Accessing memory that a process is not allowed to access, often due to pointer errors.
Format String Vulnerabilities: Using format strings (like in printf) that allow for arbitrary memory reads and writes.
Resource Leaks: Failure to release other resources (e.g., file handles, network sockets) after use. 

Memory Management Errors:
Memory Leaks: Failure to deallocate dynamically allocated memory.
Dangling Pointers: Pointers that point to memory that has been freed.
Double Free Errors: Attempting to free the same memory block twice.
Use-After-Free Errors: Accessing memory after it has been deallocated.
Buffer Overflows (Stack): Writing beyond the bounds of a stack-allocated buffer.
Buffer Overflows (Heap): Writing beyond the bounds of a heap-allocated buffer.
Heap Corruption: Damage to the heap's internal data structures.
Stack Corruption: Damage to the call stack, potentially leading to crashes or unexpected behavior.
Uninitialized Memory: Reading from memory that has not been assigned a value.
Invalid Pointer Arithmetic: Performing pointer arithmetic that goes outside the bounds of an allocated block.
Out-of-Bounds Array Access: Accessing an array element beyond its defined range.
Memory Alignment Issues: Incorrect data alignment, causing hardware exceptions.
Segmentation Faults: Attempting to access memory that the process does not have permission to access.
Null Pointer Dereference: Attempting to access memory through a NULL pointer.
Resource Exhaustion: Running out of available memory or other system resources.
Integer Overflow (Heap Allocation): Overflowing an integer used to calculate the size of a memory allocation, resulting in too little memory being allocated.
Integer Underflow (Heap Allocation): Underflowing an integer used to calculate the size of a memory allocation. 
Concurrency and Multithreading Errors:
Race Conditions: Multiple threads accessing and modifying shared data concurrently without proper synchronization.
Deadlocks: A situation where two or more threads are blocked indefinitely, waiting for each other.
Livelocks: Threads repeatedly change state in response to each other, without making progress.
Starvation: A thread is perpetually denied access to a needed resource.
Data Races: Multiple threads access the same memory location concurrently, and at least one of them is a write operation.
Incorrect Locking Granularity: Locking too much or too little code, leading to performance problems or race conditions.
Missing Synchronization: Failing to protect shared data with appropriate synchronization primitives (mutexes, semaphores, etc.).
Incorrect Use of Condition Variables: Using condition variables incorrectly, leading to missed wake-ups or spurious wake-ups.
Priority Inversion: A high-priority thread is blocked by a lower-priority thread.
Context Switching Overhead: Excessive context switching, leading to performance degradation.
False Sharing: Threads accessing different memory locations that happen to reside on the same cache line, causing unnecessary cache invalidations.
