# Constant
CA9, a custom programming language based on overwhelming developers.
## Ideals
* ### Structure
  * Low Level to High Level:
  * First to last compilation like C++; 
  * Allows Direct Expressions in assembly with an assembly scope: \_\_{ASSEMBLY}\_\_ or assembly {};
  * Low level: compiles to assembly;
  * High level: strong library system provides the highest level of customization for applications;

* ### Debugging
  * life
  * scope
  * graph

* ### Conditional Execution
Errors  
  * pre
  * post
  * try
    * throw
    * catch
    * finally
Branches
  * switch
    * case
    * if 
    * then
    * else
    * default
Iterations
  * loop
    * for
    * do
    * while
    * until
Recursion
  * recurse
    * memo
* ### Concurrency and Parallelism
  * async
    * lazy
    * promise
      * kept
      * broken
    * wait
      * await
      * yield
* ### Deduplication
  * interface
  * contract
  * implement
  * struct
  * macros
  * get
  * set
* ### AI supported architecture customization
