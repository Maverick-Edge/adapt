# adapt
Adapt, a custom programming language based off of C++.
## Ideals
* ### Structure
  * Low Level to High Level:
  * First to last compilation like C++; 
  * Allows Direct Expressions in assembly with an underscored scope: \_\_{ASSEMBLY}\_\_;
  * Low level: compiles to assembly;
  * High level: strong library system provides the highest level of customization for applications;
* ### Library
